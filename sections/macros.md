# Macros

Macros are reusable action sequences that agents can apply to a ticket with one click. A single macro can change the status, set the priority, assign an agent, add a reply, and more -- all at once.

## Macro actions

Each macro contains one or more actions that execute in order:

- **Change status** -- set the ticket status
- **Change priority** -- set the ticket priority
- **Assign agent** -- assign the ticket to a specific agent
- **Change department** -- move the ticket to a department
- **Add tags** -- apply tags to the ticket
- **Send reply** -- add a public reply to the conversation
- **Add note** -- add an internal note visible only to agents

## Shared vs. personal macros

- **Shared macros** are visible to all agents and managed by admins
- **Personal macros** are visible only to the agent who created them

Admins manage macros from the `Admin -> Macros` page. The action builder lets you add, reorder, and configure each step visually.
