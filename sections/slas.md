# SLAs & Escalation

Define service level agreements with per-priority response and resolution time targets. Escalation rules trigger automatically when conditions are met.

- SLA policies with first-response and resolution targets per priority level
- Business-hours-only mode for SLA calculations
- Escalation rules with configurable conditions (status, age, SLA breach), including trigger categories
- Automatic actions: escalate, change priority, assign, change department
- Time-based automations for scheduled actions beyond immediate SLA checks
- All managed from the admin panel -- no code required
