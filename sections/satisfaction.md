# Customer Satisfaction

Collect feedback from customers after a ticket is resolved. A simple 5-star rating prompt appears on the ticket page with an optional comment field.

## How it works

- When a ticket is resolved or closed, the customer sees a "How was your experience?" prompt
- 5-star rating with hover labels (Terrible, Poor, Okay, Good, Excellent)
- Optional comment for detailed feedback
- Works for both authenticated customers and guest ticket holders
- One rating per ticket -- replaces if resubmitted

## For agents & admins

- Read-only rating displayed in the ticket sidebar
- CSAT metrics in the admin reports dashboard: average score, total ratings, and breakdown by star level
- Dedicated CSAT settings page for tuning survey behavior and collection defaults
