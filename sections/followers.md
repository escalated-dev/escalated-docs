# Ticket Followers

Agents can follow tickets to receive notifications on updates without being the assignee. This is useful for managers who want oversight, or agents who escalated a ticket but want to stay in the loop.

- Follower count displayed on the follow button
- Followers are notified on new replies and status changes
- "Following" quick filter chip to find tickets you're watching
- Filter by "Following" in the advanced ticket filters
