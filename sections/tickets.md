# Tickets

Tickets are the core of Escalated. Each ticket is a long-lived state machine with a full conversation history, priority levels, assignment tracking, and SLA monitoring.

> **Note:** Every ticket gets a unique reference (e.g., `ESC-00001`) and supports custom statuses, priority levels, department assignment, tags, SLA tracking, and rich conversations with file attachments. All data lives in your database.
