# Conversations

Each ticket contains a threaded conversation between the requester and support agents. Internal notes let your team collaborate without exposing messages to the customer.

> **Note:**
>
> - Public replies visible to both customer and agents
> - Internal notes visible only to agents
> - File attachments on replies (configurable size and count limits)
> - Canned responses for common agent replies
> - Pinnable internal notes -- pin important notes to the top of the ticket for quick reference
